### What I learned

when I do this challenge I learn one new thing which is when we make an element a grid-container we can align the grid-items inside of the column and row they are spaning by using margin auto proeprty.
for example:-
I have article element with a class of car which have four elements. I gave it a min-height property of 497px and I made this element a grid-container with 4 rows and 1 columns. I gave a size of auto for my three elements which spans the first three rows and I gave 1fr to the fourth element which spans remaining space at the bottom (fourth row). so I can postion the last element inside the fourth row wherever I want by using margin auto property.

```
html
   <article class="car suvs">
        <img src="./images/icon-suvs.svg" alt="" class="logo">
        <h1 class="car-brand">SUVs</h1>

        <p class="description">Take an SUV for its spacious interior, power, and versatility. Perfect for your next
          family vacation
          and off-road adventures.
        </p>

        <a href="#" class="learn-btn">Learn More</a> <!--fourth item-->
      </article>
```

```
css
.car{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, auto) 1fr;
    align-content: start;
}

  /* this element will be positioned at the bottom-left corner because it put the remaining space other than it's content at the top and right place from it. */
 .learn-btn {
    margin-top: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
  }


```

### Continued development

in the near feautre I want to focus on grid,flexbox,responsive design and css animation.
